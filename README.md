# Expo CLI Development Server Random Crash

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes randomly without providing any error messages in the console. This makes debugging challenging due to the lack of specific error information.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `expo start`. Observe that after a random amount of time the server may crash without any specific error messages. 

## Potential Causes

* Possible memory leaks within Expo CLI or its dependencies.
* Unhandled exceptions deep within the development server's process.
* Incompatibilities with certain system configurations.

## Solution

This is a complex problem to directly solve as the root cause can be difficult to trace. However, you can try the approaches described in the `expoBugSolution.js` file, such as monitoring resource usage, upgrading dependencies, or searching for relevant issues on Expo's GitHub repository.

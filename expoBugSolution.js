The solution involves multiple strategies to pinpoint and address the issue. Because the crash lacks specific error information, a systematic approach is necessary:

**1. Resource Monitoring:** 
Start by monitoring the CPU and memory usage of the development server. If there's a noticeable spike or leak before the crash, it can hint at a performance-related problem.

**2. Dependency Updates:**
Ensure all Expo CLI packages and related dependencies (React Native, etc.) are updated to the latest stable versions. Outdated packages sometimes contain known bugs that have been fixed in newer releases.

**3. Log Level Increase:**
Try to increase the log level of the Expo development server to capture more detailed information, which might unveil underlying exceptions during the crash. It's also important to check the system's logs for any relevant errors.

**4. Clean Build:**
Remove the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies. This can often resolve issues stemming from corrupted or incomplete package installations. 

**5. Issue Search:**
Check the Expo GitHub repository for similar issues. The issue might be a known bug with a workaround, or you can find the solution suggested by the community. 

**Example (Conceptual):**

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js - This file shows conceptual improvements. 
// The solution will be a combination of the mentioned strategies
// rather than a single code change.

// Example: checking for memory leaks (requires external libraries)
// ... (Code for monitoring memory usage, etc.)...
```
